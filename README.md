UCCD2513 T14 Week 9 Activity

1. Apply Hough transform (circular objects detection) and blob detection algorithm to detect coins present in image 'coins_1.jfif'. Comment on the outcomes of two methods.
2. Apply k-means clustering on 'zebra.jfif' to segment out the zebra.
  - You are required to determine the optimal k by plotting the within cluster sum of squares vs number of clusters (2-10).
  - Apply the clustering method on 2 color space: BGR and HSV and compare the results obtained.
